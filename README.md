# Learning Game Project

This is a full-stack learning game where users can select a subject, get a short explanation generated by an LLM (Large Language Model), and answer a set of questions. The project uses React for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and MongoDB for storing user data.

## Features
- Select a subject and receive a dynamically generated explanation.
- Answer 10 multiple-choice questions, with a progress tracker.
- At the end of the quiz, view a summary of correct and incorrect answers, with explanations.
- Option to start a new subject from the summary page.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **LLM Integration**: LLaMA 3 with Groq API

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Backend (Flask)
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

#### Installation
1. Navigate to the `backend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend/
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python use_llm.py
   ```

By default, the Flask server will run on **http://localhost:5001**.

### 2. Frontend (React)
#### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- npm (Node package manager)

#### Installation
1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend/
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

By default, the React server will run on **http://localhost:3000**.

### 3. Database (MongoDB)
Ensure MongoDB is installed and running. You can follow the official [MongoDB installation guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) for your system.

## Testing the Application

1. **Manual Testing**: Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should be able to:
   - Select a subject and get an explanation.
   - Answer 10 questions with multiple choices.
   - View the quiz progress and summary after completing the quiz.

2. **Unit Testing (Backend)**:
   You can run unit tests for the backend functions using `unittest` or `pytest`.

3. **Integration Testing**:
   Test the full flow by checking the interaction between the React frontend and Flask backend, ensuring the requests and responses are correct.

## Usage

1. **Homepage**: When you open the app, you'll see a prompt asking, "What do you want to learn today?".
2. **Select Subject**: Choose a subject from the options.
3. **Quiz**: A short explanation will be generated, followed by 10 multiple-choice questions.
4. **Progress Tracker**: Track your progress through the quiz with "x/10" at the bottom of the screen.
5. **Summary Page**: After answering all questions, you'll see a summary of your correct and incorrect answers, along with explanations.

## API Endpoints
- **POST /generate**: Generates a paragraph and question based on the subject provided.
  - Request body: `{ "subject": "string" }`
  - Response: `{ "paragraph": "string", "question": "string", "answers": [ "string", "string", "string", "string" ] }`

## Future Improvements
- Add user authentication for tracking learning progress over time.
- Include a leaderboard or gamification elements.
- Expand the database with more subjects and question sets.
